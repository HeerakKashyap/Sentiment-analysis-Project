Visualized **IMDB** movie reviews for the movies that were annotated in positive, neutral and negative classes , made sure **data** imbalance was not there. Data pre-processing was done.
Further Tokenization and Pad Sequences were applied to the data, we set up the LSTM model with Embedding, Lstm, Dense Layers.complied the model with adam, binary, cross entropy and metrics as accuracy.
Trained the model with 5 epochs, Model evaluation was done with 92% Accuracy on test data and finally made a predictive sysytem.
